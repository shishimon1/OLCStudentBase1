# ________________________________________
# Task 5.1 [4]
# Write a calculate_days( ) function that accepts a date parameter in the format "DD-MM".

# The function will check if an item has expired and return the number of days 
# between today’s date and the expiry date.
# •	Expiry is calculated by subtracting the today’s date from the expiry date. 
# You must use the calculate_days() function to retrieve the number of days between

# 2.	Both the day (DD) and month (MM) must be two characters long (e.g. "05-04" not "5-4").
# 3.	The day (DD) must be between 1 and 30 (inclusive).
# 4.	The month (MM) must be between 1 and 12 (inclusive).
